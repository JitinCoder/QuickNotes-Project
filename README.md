A big part of the digital revolution is note-taking apps. Writing down meeting notes, ideas, research, daily to-dos, etc. has never been easier- thanks to the note-taking apps.

INTRODUCTION:-

Note-taking is the practice of writing down or recording information from different sources, platforms, and events. It is usually done by jotting down key points, paraphrasing big data, and sometimes even sketching or drawing images

The purpose of note-taking is to make sure that you are able to capture the essence of a set of information so that you are not burdened with memorizing everything word by word.

Now that we are living in a world where life without technology is unimaginable, our note-taking practice has gone digital. Thatâ€™s why Digital Note Making is very essential.

This app allow you to:

1. Organize and store all important information and notes digitally on localStorage via JavaScript.
2. View Notes.
3. Delete Notes.
4. Search Notes.

This Quick Note making App can help us ensure we never forget a flash of creative inspiration. Writing things down on paper is all well and good, but we find it's very easy to lose our notes that way. But storing our thoughts, ideas and concepts electronically keeps them safe, secure and, best of all, searchable so that we can find them quickly when we need to. 

In short, with note-taking apps, our note-taking has now become simpler and easier.
